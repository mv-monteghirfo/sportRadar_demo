1 - A Singleton pattern would be a good option having the understanding 
of the entity Board as a service. Given the requirement of "simplicity"
that implementation has been left and leave the library able to have 
different boards 
2 - An interface has been created for the sake of the design, but for
the simplicity required, the Board should be left like it is and, if it
has to grow in the future or have interfaces to be segregated it would 
be easy to refactor it following the Interface Segregation principle.
