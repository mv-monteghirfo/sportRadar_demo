1 - A Singleton pattern would be a good option having the understanding 
of the entity Board as a service. Given the requirement of "simplicity"
that implementation has been left and leave the library able to have 
different boards 
2 - An interface has been created for the sake of the design, but for
the simplicity required, the Board should be left like it is and, if it
has to grow in the future or have interfaces to be segregated it would 
be easy to refactor it following the Interface Segregation principle.
3 - An ADT would have been used for the collection to hide the data layer
and expose only the operations needed. Again, for the simplicity requirements
a Map has been used rawly.
4 - For the same reason only the "happy path" of the control flow has been tested.
without having instructions of the use cases that can occur, uses like trying to
create the same match twice, eliminate a match already eliminated, etc. have been
left, because the requirements may state to treat them as special exceptions,
void behavior, etc.
